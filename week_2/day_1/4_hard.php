<!-- 
	Using everything you have learned and some googling

	- Find all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible evenly by 3
	- From that list of numbers, also find all the numbers that divisible evenly by 6
	- Display each set of numbers with a comma delimited list
	- Also display how many numbers are divisible by 3 and by 6 respectively

	Expected Results

	 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, etc
	 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc

	 Divisible by 3 = ###
	 Divisible by 6 = ###
