<!-- 
	Using everything you have learned and some googling

  Imagine this is a post page and they have sent you a number
  you want to return them the number it text format. For instance:
    
    - 1 -> one
    - 2 -> two

  but anything that is above 10 we want to return "Nothing is greater than 10"
